# Programming Tasks (PD Tasks) Repository  

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of basic programming tasks that I have completed as part of my journey into the world of programming. Written in **C++**, these tasks form the foundation of my programming skills, showcasing how I transitioned from a beginner to a confident problem solver.

## üõ†Ô∏è Purpose  

The purpose of this repository is to document and share my learning process, demonstrating the progression of programming concepts over time. It serves as a resource for:  

- **Learning Basics**: For beginners who are starting with programming in C++.  
- **Concept Reinforcement**: For those looking to strengthen their understanding of programming fundamentals.  
- **Portfolio**: As evidence of my commitment to learning and improving my programming skills.

## üìö Contents  

This repository is organized into various sections, each representing a specific set of programming concepts and problem-solving tasks:  

1. **Basic Input/Output Operations**  
   - Understanding `cin` and `cout` for user interaction.  
   - Writing simple programs to process user inputs and display outputs.  

2. **Control Flow Constructs**  
   - Implementation of conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`).  
   - Usage of loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`) to perform repetitive tasks.  

3. **Functions and Recursion**  
   - Writing reusable functions with proper parameter passing.  
   - Recursive solutions to mathematical problems like factorials, Fibonacci, etc.  

4. **Arrays and Strings**  
   - Solving problems involving single and multi-dimensional arrays.  
   - String manipulation tasks using basic C++ string functions.  

5. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
   - Introduction to classes, objects, and encapsulation.  
   - Practicing simple programs with constructors, destructors, and member functions.  

6. **Data Structures (Introduction)**  
   - Implementing stacks, queues, and linked lists in their basic forms.
